MP3A â€“ HTML Homepage Prototype - corah page
First Steps - Get our Project Structure
1) Use a GitHub Repo and turn on Pages (under Settings for the repo - Pages).  The repo has to be public.
2) I recommend a folder called corah_site or a dedicated Repo
3) Create icons, images folders, index.html, styles.css
4) Populate the index.html file with a basic page (in vscode type ! and then enter)
5) Test your url.  Mine is Welcome to Corah
 
To set up Pages - Go to Settings under Repo - Pages (left bottom menu) - Select Main branch and Press "Save"
